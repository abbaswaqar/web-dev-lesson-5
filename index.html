                        <h2>Dogs</h2>
                        <p>Dogs are domesticated mammals and descendants of wolves, scientifically known as Canis lupus familiaris. They were one of the first animals to be domesticated by humans<br>
                          over 15,000 years ago. Dogs are highly social, intelligent, and loyal animals, often trained for tasks like hunting, herding, guarding, and companionship. They come in<br>
                         hundreds of breeds with a wide range of sizes, shapes, and temperaments. Known for their strong sense of smell and hearing, dogs are also used in police work, search-and-rescue<br>
                         missions, and therapy services.</p>
